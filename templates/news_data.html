<p>
The sprinting continues today in Atlanta after a week where at least a dozen people got involved,
some new to SQLAlchemy, some veterans.   New things coming out include our <a href="http://buildbot.sqlalchemy.org/">all-new
buildbot</a>, as well as several new dialects which are Python 3 compatible - PyPostgreql, OurSQL, MySQL-connector-Python.  Python 3 tests
are passing 100% for pg8000 and OurSQL, so Postgresql and MySQL are now covered for Python 3.  We also have mxODBC for MSSQL in the
works and have made a great leap forward in getting real Sybase support.   Plus documentation updates galore, new
declarative features, and a whole host of fixes and enhancements elsewhere.   We'll soon be posting
links to SQLAlchemy related talks and tutorials from Pycon 2010 as they become available.  Thanks to 
everyone for the huge amount of involvement and stay tuned for SQLAlchemy 0.6 !

<%call expr="newsitem(headline='SQLAlchemy 0.6 On Its Way', date=datetime.date(2009, 8, 7))">

<p>SQLAlchemy 0.6 is now on trunk, with release candidates to come soon.   Jython compatibility
is near 100% for MySQL and Postgresql, with work being done for Oracle + JDBC as well.
Oracle tests using cPython pass at 100% and compatibility is also introduced for MSSQL
via PyODBC with FreeTDS, allowing any unix platform to access MSSQL (one user is testing
it against Sybase ASE as well with a good deal of success).  INSERT RETURNING support
is also implemented natively for Postgresql, Oracle, MSSQL and Firebird and is used when
available to fetch newly generated primary key identifiers.</p>
<p>
The release of 0.6 will solidify the best architecture yet for maximum Python platform, DBAPI,
and database backend compatibility, allowing new DBAPIs and architectures to be plugged in
with minimal hacking.

As of this past weekend, <a href="http://twitter.com/zzzeek/status/1984474807">100% of tests pass</a> on Python 3000 using
the up-and-coming 0.6 series of SQLAlchemy, while running on sqlite via the sqlite3 adapter
as well as Postgresql via the <a href="http://pybrary.net/pg8000/">pg8000</a> DBAPI.   
Jython compatibility is largely present as well.   The 0.6 series has
a special focus on environment and dialect compatibility, as well as on schema construct and DDL improvements.  
Developers will have full access to new expression constructs such as CREATE TABLE and ADD CONSTRAINT, with the ability
to define new ones.  It is now possible to construct custom create/drop sequences which add constraints, triggers 
and other DDL using rules that are sensitive to the underlying database in use - and will allow smoother integration
with <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sqlalchemy-migrate/">sqlalchemy-migrate</a> too.  0.6 should be merged to trunk
soon with alpha releases by mid-summer.

This version packs a huge amount of change since 0.4 including multiple paradigm shifts in usage as well as countless bugfixes and behavioral and speed improvements.  Through a series of prereleases, 0.5 is already on production systems and has been extensively tested by dozens of users.  With the first 0.5 release, 0.6 is underway as well and will be where Py3k support is targeted.  SQLAlchemy 0.5 is available for download on the <a href="/download.html">download page</a>.

<%call expr="newsitem(headline='Django to Integrate SQLAlchemy', date=datetime.date(2006,8,30))">Python megaframework <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a> has decided to take the plunge and <a href="http://tinyurl.com/htvwu">create a port of its ORM based on SQLAlchemy</a>.  Adrian Holovaty has skillfully led Django from an in-house project to Guido's favorite choice in a short time, and the move to allow full SQLAlchemy integration will help Django grow beyond its roots into a more broadly scoped system.  It will be interesting to see how the move comes to fruition. Adrian says Django's ORM interface will remain, and the SQLAlchemy API will be exposable for the purposes of doing something "truly complicated".  But SA fans know its not really about "complexity", its about embracing the idea of "rows and relations" instead of just tables.  Should Django's ORM layer itself start to adopt more of SA's style of thinking, Django users might decide that SA's view of databases works just great for everyday tasks as well.

Simpler and finer-grained APIs have been created for the engine/SQL execution system, the mapper/query system and the unit of work/session system.
