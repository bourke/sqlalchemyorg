SQLAlchemy release 1.0.4 is now available.

With release 1.0.4 we are pretty much through all the bumps we had
in the 0.9 to 1.0 movement.  Four additional very minor regressions are
solved in this release.     Most prominently, another issue regarding
recent enhancements to the ``Query.column_descriptions`` collection,
also slated for release in 0.9.10, was fixed.

Changelog for 1.0.4 is at:
