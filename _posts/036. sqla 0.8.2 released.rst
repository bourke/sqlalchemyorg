SQLAlchemy release 0.8.2 is now available.

0.8.2 includes several dozen bug fixes and new features, including
refinement of some of the new features introduced in 0.8.

Areas of improvement include Core, ORM, as well as specific fixes
for dialects such as Postgresql, MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, Firebird
and Sybase.

Users should carefully review the `Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_0_8_2>`_ to
note which behaviors and issues are affected.   We'd like to thank
the many contributors who helped with this release.

SQLAlchemy 0.8.2 is available on the `Download Page </download.html>`_.
