title: SQLAlchemy 1.0.5 Released
author: Mike B

SQLAlchemy release 1.0.5 is now available.

Release 1.0.5 is mostly a bugfix release, in particular repairing
some issues with MutableType as well as improving support for Postgresql
under Pypy.

It also has an improvement to the SQL Server dialect which
removes an old legacy system of attempting to rewrite SQL statements that
include a schema qualifier; the system remains in place by default for the 1.0
series, however can be disabled using a new ``create_engine()`` flag.
As the flag will most likely be reversed in the 1.1 series,
a warning is emitted when schema-qualified tables are
used without a true/false setting for this flag.  SQL Server applications
that use remote schemas will want to begin experimenting with disabling
this behavior in preparation for it being disabled by default.
