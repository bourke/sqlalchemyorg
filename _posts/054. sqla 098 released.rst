title: SQLAlchemy 0.9.8 Released
author: Mike B
---

SQLAlchemy release 0.9.8 is now available.

As the 1.0 series is `well underway </docs/latest/changelog/migration_10.html>`_,
0.9.8 continues to close out bugs that can still be applied without
significant risk of destabilization.  In contrast to 0.9.7 where we
were still hitting upon regressions, 0.9.8 fixes a set of garden variety bugs,
many of which are related to changes in DBAPIs (new SQL Server version strings,
new Psycopg2 error conditions, changes in MySQL-connector-python and pg8000).
That being said, 0.9.8 has a relatively large amount of fixes overall.

Users should carefully review the `Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_0_9_8>`_ to
note which behaviors and issues are affected.   We'd like to thank
the many contributors who helped with this release.

SQLAlchemy 0.9.8 is available on the `Download Page </download.html>`_.
