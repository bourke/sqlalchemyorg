SQLAlchemy release 1.2.8 is now available.

Release 1.2.8 includes a fairly broad spectrum of fixes, including
fixes for some memory/synchronization issues within the connection pool,
automap and statement caching functionalities, as well as some issues that
were introduced in the 1.2 series related to the horizontal sharding
extension as well as the dogpile.caching example.   Users of the dogpile.cache
recipe should review the changes here when migrating to SQLAlchemy 1.2.
