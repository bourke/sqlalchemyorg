title: SQLAlchemy 0.9.1 Released
author: Mike B
---

SQLAlchemy release 0.9.1 is now available.

This release is primarily a quick-hit regression release; as we moved
fast through 0.9 betas only releasing a single beta, a couple of small regressions
popped up since then; this release fixes those.

The release does however include one major, though experimental feature.
After spending many hours on IRC with a particular user's use case of
automatically generating ``relationship()`` objects for an existing schema,
a new extension is proposed known as ``sqlalchemy.ext.automap``.  Automap
expands upon the Declarative model as well as the "deferred reflection" class
to attempt producing a full model at runtime based on a reflected, or
otherwise non-mapped, schema collection.   In some ways, Automap can more or
less replace what the very famous
`SQLSoup <https://sqlsoup.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ extension has historically
been used for, e.g. to generate classes on the fly based on a reflected schema.
Automap expands on this idea by proposing simple logic to also generate
rudimentary relationships between classes, and also is structured so as to
interoperate smoothly with the Declarative mapping system that didn't exist when
SQLSoup was created.
