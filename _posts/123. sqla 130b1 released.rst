SQLAlchemy release 1.3.0b1 is now available.

This is the initial beta release in the 1.3 series of SQLAlchemy, the latest
iteration of new features and behavioral improvements.   Highlights of
1.3 include:

* Performance improvements to the new "select in" loader strategy, such
  that a JOIN is no longer used at all to load collections

* JSON support for SQLite

* Support for SQLite's "ON CONFLICT" constraint directive

* Improvements to the new "expanding" bound parameter used for "IN" expressions,
  such that empty "IN" expressions are now supported

* new schema naming convention features and support for automatic truncation
  of long names

* a series of architectural and API improvements to the association proxy
  extension

* architectural and behavioral improvements to the ``Query.join()`` method

* Improvements to rendering and reflection of FULLTEXT indexes on MySQL

* Support for pyodbc's "fast executemany" mode for SQL Server

* Architectural improvements and updates to the cx_oracle dialect to keep up
  with the high velocity of changes being made to this DBAPI upstream

Release 1.3 includes approximately 39 individual improvements and features.
