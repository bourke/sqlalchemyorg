title: SQLAlchemy 1.3.11 Released
author: Mike B

SQLAlchemy release 1.3.11 is now available.

Release 1.3.11 has a significant number of bug fixes across all areas as well
as new use case additions.  While it is a "point release", it contains a few
use case additions that amount to new features, as they are needed sooner than
the 1.4 series will be ready.   This includes new scalar accessors for JSON
index expressions that work across all JSON-supporting backends as well as
cross-dialect support for the "GENERATED ALWAYS AS" SQL construct, which allows
for an automatically updated expression to be established within DDL in  the
database server.

See the changelog for descriptions of these new features as well as
an overview of bug fixes.

As is the case with all releases, we'd like to thank all the contributors who
helped with this release.
