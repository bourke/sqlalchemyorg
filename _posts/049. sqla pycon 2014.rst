title: SQLAlchemy at Pycon 2014
author: Mike B

SQLAlchemy had a big year at this year's `Pycon North America <https://us.pycon.org/2014/>`_
presented in Montr√©al, Canada.   Conference presentations were given by three separate
speakers, and a three hour tutorial session was given as well.   Videos and supporting documents
are now available in the new `SQLAlchemy Library </library.html>`_, a new
site section where we're gathering every kind of learning resource we can
for SQLAlchemy in one place.

Links to talks:

* `Building the App </library.html#buildingtheapp>`_ - Mike Bayer
* `Sane schema migrations with Alembic and SQLAlchemy </library.html#saneschemamigrationswithalembicandsqlalchemy>`_ - Selena Deckelmann
* `Introduction to SQLAlchemy Core </library.html#introductiontosqlalchemycore>`_- Jason Meyers

This year's tutorial was a replay of `Introduction to SQLAlchemy </library.html#introductiontosqlalchemy>`_, the
intro tutorial that's been presented at many conferences.
