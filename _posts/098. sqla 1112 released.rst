SQLAlchemy release 1.1.12 is now available.

This release repairs an issue in the test suite that would prevent
the suite from passing on Python version 3.6.2.   The release is
made at the same time as that of release 1.0.18 and 1.2.0b2.  Also included
are fixes related to ORM use of JSON NULL values, subquery eager loading,
and a stability enhancement involving the identity map when used under
high concurrency.

Changelog for 1.1.12 is at `Changelog </changes/CHANGES_1_1_12>`_.

SQLAlchemy 1.1.12 is available on the `Download Page </download.html>`_.
