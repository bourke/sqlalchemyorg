title: SQLAlchemy 1.3.9 Released
author: Mike B

SQLAlchemy release 1.3.9 is now available.

Release 1.3.9 contains a variety of bug fixes and use case additions.

In particular is included support for Oracle's updated max identifier length
which is 128 as of Oracle 12.2; release 1.3 won't adjust automatically,
but will emit a warning that recommends the application set the
desired identifier length explicitly using a new parameter
``max_identifier_length``; the value will default to 128 for server version
12.2 and above in the 1.4 series.

Release 1.3.9 also includes support for SQLite "URI" connections supported by
the Python 3 version of the driver.   An ORM regression which appeared in
version 1.3.6 involving the "selectinload" loader strategy is also fixed.

As is the case with all releases, we'd like to thank all the contributors who
helped with this release.

Changelog for 1.3.9 is at `Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_1_3_9>`_.
