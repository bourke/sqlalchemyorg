title: SQLAlchemy 1.0.11 Released
author: Mike B
---

SQLAlchemy release 1.0.11 is now available.

Release 1.0.11, only twelve days after 1.0.10's release, is expedited to
correct for one ORM-related regression introduced by a 1.0.10 fix; some other
fairly significant bugfixes involving more recently added features, all
reported subsequent to the release of 1.0.10, were also fixed.
Fixes include a major issue in the "baked lazy loader" extension when used as a
systemwide-replacement for lazy loading, a major series of fixes to the
"eager_defaults" mapper persistence option, and a revision to 1.0.10's fix for
a particular polymorphic joined-eager loading issue.

Changelog for 1.0.11 is at:
