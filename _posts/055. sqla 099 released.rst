title: SQLAlchemy 0.9.9 Released
author: Mike B

SQLAlchemy release 0.9.9 is now available.

Release 0.9.9 is a large maintenance release featuring 30 changes,
mostly bug fixes.  A handful of modest feature adds are also present,
including new Core features for SQLite, Postgresql, and new
API features to provide better control of transaction isolation level
when using the ORM.

The majority of SQLAlchemy development is taking place targeted at
version 1.0, which is extremely close to having its initial beta releases.
Version 1.0 has accumulated a wide variety of performance improvements,
both as intrinsic to normal operation as well as via new features.

Users should carefully review the `Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_0_9_9>`_ to
note which behaviors and issues are affected.   We'd like to thank
the many contributors who helped with this release.

SQLAlchemy 0.9.9 is available on the `Download Page </download.html>`_.
