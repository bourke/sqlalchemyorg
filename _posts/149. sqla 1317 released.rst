title: SQLAlchemy 1.3.17 Released
author: Mike B

SQLAlchemy release 1.3.17 is now available.

Release 1.3.17 fixes a variety of issues across the ORM, engine, and
dialect-level components, as well as includes some new use case additions.
Among the fixes is a connection-pool related issue which could under some
less common circumstances lead towards the "rollback agent" not functioning
correctly in the pool.  The release also includes a new feature
"sync_backref=False" that hopes to ease the use of viewonly relationships
within backref combinations.

See the changelog for descriptions of this and other fixes.

As is the case with all releases, we'd like to thank all the contributors who
helped with this release.
