SQLAlchemy release 1.0.13 is now available.

Release 1.0.13 fixes a variety of issues targeted at the 1.0 series that have
been resolved over the past several weeks.  Fixes include small issues
repaired in the ORM, Core, Postgresql, Oracle, SQL Server dialects.  Most
issues are very minor with the exception of one
issue involving Oracle LOB types in conjunction with query caching
(such as that used by the ``sqlalchemy.ext.baked``) extension which would
cause result set fetches to fail.

Changelog for 1.0.13 is at:
