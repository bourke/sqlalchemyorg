SQLAlchemy release 1.1.18 is now available.

Release 1.1.18 has two dialect-specific issues backported from 1.2.5,
which are a Python 3.7 regression in the Postgresql dialect, as well as
an adjustment to all MySQL dialects to utilize a distinct query to
obtain the server version rather than relying upon the DBAPI, which fixes
issues with certain proxy servers.

Changelog for 1.1.18 is at `Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_1_1_18>`_.

SQLAlchemy 1.1.18 is available on the `Download Page </download.html>`_.
