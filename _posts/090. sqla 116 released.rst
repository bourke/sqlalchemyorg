title: SQLAlchemy 1.1.6 Released

SQLAlchemy release 1.1.6 is now available.

Release 1.1.6 continues to provide bug fixes and some new features within the
1.1 series.  As we begin to lead into the development phase  for 1.2 and
solidify the 1.1 series as "done", additional behavioral improvements will more
likely to be targeted at 1.2 rather than 1.1.   Nevertheless, 1.1.6 includes a
few fairly major behavioral improvements in the area of performance; some
significant performance issues within the "joined eager loading" functionality
were identified and repaired, which should cut the Python-level latency for
such a query roughly in half, as well as an unnecessary SELECT which could emit
when using the "eager defaults" feature was repaired.

Changelog for 1.1.6 is at `Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_1_1_6>`_.
