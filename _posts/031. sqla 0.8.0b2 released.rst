title: SQLAlchemy 0.8.0b2 Released
author: Mike B
---
The second beta release of the 0.8 series is now released.

This release fixes some regressions found in 0.8.0b1 and improves upon some
of what's new in 0.8.  In particular, a second rework of the "pathing" mechanics
which relate loader strategies to entity paths allows for more elaborate "polymorphic"
loading schemes than before.   The Postgresql HSTORE type has now been added
fully to the Postgresql dialect, and there are many dialect-specific fixes including
several for Oracle.

It is hoped that 0.8.0b2 will be the last beta before 0.8, and to encourage
more user testing, the release is available on Pypi.
Applications which absolutely need to stay on 0.7 should tag their requirements
to "SQLAlchemy < 0.8" to prevent inadvertent installs of 0.8.

Users new to 0.8 should start by reading the `What's New in 0.8 </docs/08/changelog/migration_08.html>`_
document, which introduces major new features as well as areas
where applications may experience a behavioral change.  The
`0.8.0b2 Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_0_8_0b2>`_ will enumerate
most changes in detail.

Download SQLAlchemy 0.8.0b2 on the `download page </download.html>`_.
