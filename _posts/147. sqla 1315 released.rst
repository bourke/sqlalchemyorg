title: SQLAlchemy 1.3.15 Released
author: Mike B
---

SQLAlchemy release 1.3.15 is now available.

Release 1.3.14 had a critical regression in the area of error handling
for exceptions raised during an autoflush operation, where the sys.exc_info()
function would not be interpreted correctly.   Users are advised to block
release 1.3.14 in their requirements files and move to 1.3.15.

See the changelog for descriptions of this and other fixes.

As is the case with all releases, we'd like to thank all the contributors who
helped with this release.

Changelog for 1.3.15 is at `Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_1_3_15>`_.

SQLAlchemy 1.3.15 is available on the `Download Page </download.html>`_.
