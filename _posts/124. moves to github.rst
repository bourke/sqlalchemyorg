title: SQLAlchemy and Related Projects move to Github

SQLAlchemy's primary code-hosting repository is now `Github <https://github.com>`_.

The public source repository, issue tracker and wiki now moves
underneath a new `organization <https://github.com/sqlalchemy>`_
which now is the home for `SQLAlchemy <https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy>`_
as well as related projects
`Alembic <https://github.com/sqlalchemy/alembic>`_,
`Mako Templates <https://github.com/sqlalchemy/mako>`_,
`dogpile.cache <https://github.com/sqlalchemy/dogpile.cache>`_, and others.

The move from Bitbucket has been under consideration for well over a year,
prompted by a long and slow decline in Bitbucket's quality as well as a
complete lack of features and improvements to their issue tracker, ever since
being acquired by Atlassian who sought to encourage users to move to Jira
instead. Most critically, SQLAlchemy and related projects desperately needed
the ability to apply free-form labels and  classifications to issues in order
to organize for common themes, as well as a capable search system and a modern,
responsive web interface.

The massive technical challenge to this move was the ability to import
SQLAlchemy's 4000+ issues into Github's issue tracker, as well as the many
hundreds of issues associated with other projects.   Github for many years
lacked a usable issue import system which made the move a non-starter, but
eventually a non-official issue import API was released, which after much
effort was able to do just enough to make an issue import feasible, after
several weeks of tweaking import scripts to format issues and their changes
as well as to move thousands of web requests over a rate-limited system
without being blocked.

Most recently, alternative self hosted systems like `Gitea
<https://gitea.io/>`_, which looks extremely promising, were considered as
well, but in the end, SQLAlchemy would like to do everything it can to
encourage community involvement, so it is hoped that the Github move will have
this effect.

In addition to the move to Github, the SQLAlchemy organization has been
set up as the owning namespace for these projects to further emphasize that
SQLAlchemy is more than just "zzzeek".
