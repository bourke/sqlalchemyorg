title: SQLAlchemy 1.2.0b2 Released
author: Mike B
---

SQLAlchemy release 1.2.0b2 is now available.

This release repairs an issue in the test suite that would prevent
the suite from passing on Python version 3.6.2.   The release is
made at the same time as that of release 1.0.18 and 1.1.12.  Also included
are fixes related to ORM use of JSON NULL values, subquery eager loading,
and a stability enhancement involving the identity map when used under
high concurrency.  New keyword options are also introduced on the
``Sequence`` construct.

The 1.2.0 series still has some more improvements that should be expected
in a 1.2.0b3 release before moving to the final 1.2.0 release.

Users should carefully review the `What's New in SQLAlchemy 1.2? </docs/latest/changelog/migration_12.html>`_ document as well as the `Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_1_2_0b2>`_ to
note which behaviors and issues are affected.   We'd like to thank
the many contributors who helped with this release.

SQLAlchemy 1.2.0b2 is available on the `Download Page </download.html>`_.
