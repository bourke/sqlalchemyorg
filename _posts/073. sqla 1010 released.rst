title: SQLAlchemy 1.0.10 Released

SQLAlchemy release 1.0.10 is now available.

Release 1.0.10 continues with maintenance fixes as we continue major
development on the 1.1 series.   Fixes here include a handful of fairly
obscure ORM issues, as our userbase continues to use the new loader
option system introduced in 0.9 more deeply, some adjustments to internals
to work more smoothly with the latest Python 3.5 and upcoming 3.6 versions,
an array of dialect-specific fixes, and a pretty important fix to the
new "baked query" extension.   There's also one new feature which is the ability
to render an UPDATE statement with a specific ordering of the SET clauses.

Changelog for 1.0.10 is at:
