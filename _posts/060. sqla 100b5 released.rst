SQLAlchemy release 1.0.0b5 is now available.

This release is yet another set of fixes for issues reported
by beta testers.  At this point, 1.0.0 is ready to go and should
be released very soon.

In preparation for 1.0.0, production installations that haven't yet been
tested in the 1.0 series should be making sure that their requirements
files are capped at 0.9.99, to avoid surprise upgrades.

Changelog for 1.0.0b5 is at:

`Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_1_0_0b5>`_

SQLAlchemy 1.0.0b5 is available on the `Download Page </download.html>`_.
