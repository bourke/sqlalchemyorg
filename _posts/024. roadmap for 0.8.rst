title: Roadmap for 0.8 Published
author: Mike B

The `What's new in 0.8 </trac/wiki/08Migration>`_ document is now
published on the wiki.   The work for 0.8 is around 70% completed
with the majority of "hard" reworkings finished, broken up among
various patches and Bitbucket repositories at the moment but
soon to be merged into a comprehensive 0.8 tree that will ultimately
push 0.7 into a maintenance branch.

0.8 so far has overall fewer changes than any previous major version,
though a few are significant.   It's very likely that 0.8 will pick up
a bunch more changes before it lands its first beta release.  

So far, the version is set to be called 0.8 but there's at least some
possibility it could be called 1.0 - stay tuned for news on that !
