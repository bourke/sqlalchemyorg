SQLAlchemy release 1.0.7 is now available.

This release contains a series of regression fixes, some additional
bugfixes, and a few new Core level features, including a new
``.cast()`` method available on column constructs as well as support for
many new keywords used in creating sequences.

Next on the roadmap for SQLAlchemy are the beginnings of the 1.1 series;
the 1.1 milestone has already accumulated several dozen proposed bugfixes
and features.  Look for development and documentation of the 1.1 series
to begin within the coming weeks.
