title: SQLAlchemy 1.3.8 Released
author: Mike B

SQLAlchemy release 1.3.8 is now available.

Release 1.3.8 is only about two weeks past release 1.3.7, and overall there
has been a high level of velocity as users continue to report lots of small
issues and often deliver pull requests to accompany them.   Release 1.3.8
includes a fix for the new psycopg2 "execute values" performance feature to
accommodate for INSERT statements that are modified by compiler hooks.

As is the case with all releases, we'd like to thank all the contributors who
helped with this release.

Changelog for 1.3.8 is at `Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_1_3_8>`_.
