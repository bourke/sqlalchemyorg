SQLAlchemy release 1.3.6 is now available.

Release 1.3.6 includes a relatively wide amount of changes including
many small bug fixes within the ORM, as well as the ability for the SQLite
dialect to render an IN expression against tuples for newer versions of
SQLite and a new capability for ORM query options to be specified
hierarchically.

As is the case with all releases, we'd like to thank all the contributors who
helped with this release.
