title: SQLAlchemy 1.0.12 Released

SQLAlchemy release 1.0.12 is now available.

Release 1.0.12 is a bug fix release resolving a handful of issues
reported in the past few weeks.   Primary development continues
on the 1.1 series which is slated for initial releases in the spring.

1.0.12 includes relatively minor fixes, including a revision to a
fix made for version 1.0.10 where we're attempting to report
on the "cause" of an error that is interupted by a later failure to
emit a ROLLBACK on the MySQL platform.  While Python 3 solves this problem
using exception chaining and cause reporting, on Python 2 we emit a warning
so that the cause isn't totally concealed.  The condition has been expanded
to emit this warning in a much wider range of scenarios.

Changelog for 1.0.12 is at:
