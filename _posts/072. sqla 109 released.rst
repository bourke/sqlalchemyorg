SQLAlchemy release 1.0.9 is now available.

Release 1.0.9 is a bugfix release, pushing out a collection of mostly
small fixes that have accumulated over the past few months.   In particular
there is one small but important fix for users of the latest cx_Oracle
library (5.2 or greater) in conjunction with Python 3 that corrects for
an important issue in correctly detecting the version of this DBAPI
and its Unicode behavior.

Primary development of new features, architectural and behavioral
improvements continues within the 1.1 series targeted at early 2016
for initial beta releases.
