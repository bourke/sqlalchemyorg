SQLAlchemy release 1.1.1 is now available.

Release 1.1.1 includes two quick hits to issues reported in 1.1.0, released
two days ago.  One is a failure to connect to some configurations of SQL Server
with pyodbc, and the other is that a newly added CompileError that intercepts
primary key issues on INSERT has been dialed back to a warning, allowing the
database to raise IntegrityError as it normally would.

Changelog for 1.1.1 is at `Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_1_1_1>`_.

SQLAlchemy 1.1.1 is available on the `Download Page </download.html>`_.
