title: SQLAlchemy 1.0.14 Released
author: Mike B
---

SQLAlchemy release 1.0.14 is now available.

This is the latest release in the 1.0 series which includes  a variety of bug
fixes that have accumulated since the last 1.0 release.  This release happens
to only feature Core and dialect level changes; none are ORM specific.  All
applicable fixes here are also in the 1.1 series, most of which are already
released as of 1.1.0b2.  As the 1.1 series moves towards final release, the 1.0
series will move into "maintenance" mode with very few additional changes being
made.

Users should review the changelog for 1.0.14 at
`Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_1_0_14>`_;  we'd like to thank
the many contributors who helped with this release.


SQLAlchemy 1.0.14 is available on the `Download Page </download.html>`_.
