SQLAlchemy release 1.3.5 is now available.

Release 1.3.5 has dialect-specific improvements for PostgreSQL and
MySQL, as well as a series of relatively subtle bug fixes and improvements
to the ORM.   Finally, an issue regarding quoting of column labels in
conjunction with the ``literal_column()`` construct is fixed.

As is the case with all releases, we'd like to thank all the contributors who
helped with this release.

Changelog for 1.3.5 is at `Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_1_3_5>`_.

SQLAlchemy 1.3.5 is available on the `Download Page </download.html>`_.
