title: SQLAlchemy 1.3.10 Released
author: Mike B

SQLAlchemy release 1.3.10 is now available.

Release 1.3.10 fixes a regression in the newly implemented Oracle max
identifier length detection which was inadvertently using the newer value of
128 on server version 12.2 and greater, despite documentation stating that
version 1.3.9 would continue to return the length of 30 unless the value were
explicitly set.   In addition, the retrieval and parsing of the "compatibility"
version has been improved and will no longer emit a warning if the
"v$parameter" table is not available, as this condition seemed to be reported
more than was anticipated. It is recommended that all Oracle users skip
release 1.3.9 and upgrade to 1.3.10.

As is the case with all releases, we'd like to thank all the contributors who
helped with this release.
