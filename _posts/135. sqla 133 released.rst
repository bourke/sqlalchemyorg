title: SQLAlchemy 1.3.3 Released
author: Mike B

SQLAlchemy release 1.3.3 is now available.

Release 1.3.3 fixes an ORM level regression and a SQLite connection-pool
related regression in the 1.3 series as well as a PostgreSQL specific
regression introduced in 1.3.2.  The ORM issue is likely the most impactful as
it affects complex ``Query.join()`` conditions that have been observed in
downstream projects.  A few other minor issues are corrected as well.

Changelog for 1.3.3 is at `Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_1_3_3>`_.

SQLAlchemy 1.3.3 is available on the `Download Page </download.html>`_.
