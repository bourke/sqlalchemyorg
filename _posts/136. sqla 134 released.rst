title: SQLAlchemy 1.3.4 Released
author: Mike B
---

SQLAlchemy release 1.3.4 is now available.

Release 1.3.4 includes a few small ORM level
regression fixes as well as adjustments and enhancements for the PostgreSQL,
MySQL and SQL Server dialects.  Additionally, it identifies differently-cased,
but otherwise equivalent identifiers within the ``GenericFunction`` system
as a deprecated use case; a warning will be emitted when two names conflict.

As is the case with all releases, we'd like to thank all the contributors who
helped with this release.

Changelog for 1.3.4 is at `Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_1_3_4>`_.

SQLAlchemy 1.3.4 is available on the `Download Page </download.html>`_.
