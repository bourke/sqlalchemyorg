SQLAlchemy release 0.9.10 is now available.

This is a maintenance release of the 0.9 series, delivering an
array of bug fixes and small feature enhancements which typically
have been backported from the 1.0 series.    As the 1.0 series
has been in production use for some months now, the 0.9 series
is expected to receive only critical bugfixes subsequent to this
version.
