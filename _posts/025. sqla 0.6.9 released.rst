title: SQLAlchemy 0.6.9 Released
author: Mike B
---
SQLAlchemy 0.6.9, a maintenance release of the 0.6 branch,
is now available.

The 0.6 series has not seen a release since 0.6.8 was
released nearly a year ago.  During that time,
the 0.7 series has gone through over six releases, gaining many
new features and bug fixes.  A portion of these fixes have been
backported to 0.6 since 0.6.8, including twelve ORM fixes, so 0.6.9 is an effort
to make these fixes widely available to those installations who have 
not yet upgraded to 0.7.   The release coincides at the same time as 
release 0.7.7, which is also fast approaching maintenance-only mode
with 0.8 now well underway and close to initial beta releases.

Care has been taken in 0.6.9 to minimize as much as possible the potential
for backwards-incompatibilities with existing code, which sometimes can
occur if an application is unknowingly relying upon a buggy behavior that
is then fixed.   So while 0.6.9 is a very conservative release, it does
still represent changes over a year's time; users are strongly urged to carefully
review the CHANGES file to see exactly what's been adjusted, 
and to test it fully in their 
existing 0.6 applications 
before promoting it to production.
