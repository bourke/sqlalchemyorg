title: SQLAlchemy 0.6.7 Released
author: Mike B
---
SQLAlchemy release 0.6.7 is now available.  This is a bugfix
release to the 0.6 series, which is now mostly feature frozen.
The 0.7 series has been the focus of new feature development 
for several months and is very near to production 
release - 0.6.7 represents all those bugfixes that were appropriate
for a backport to the maintenance series.

The 0.6 series has been SQLAlchemy's most popular ever, with 
0.6.6 alone logging over 52,000 downloads in just over three months.  

For a full list of changes in 0.6.7, see `CHANGES </changelog/CHANGES_0_6_7>`_.
