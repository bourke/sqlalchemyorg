title: SQLAlchemy 0.9.5 Released
author: Mike B
---

SQLAlchemy release 0.9.5 is now available.

0.9.5 contains mostly bug fixes as well as some smaller enhancements,
and the first to be alongside new features
and refactorings going into the 1.0 release branch.    While the issue
queue still has a handful of critical fixes to go, it's been several months
since a release so the current crop of fixes and small enhancements within
0.9.5 is due to go out.   0.9.6 should be following within the coming weeks.

Users should carefully review the `Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_0_9_5>`_ to
note which behaviors and issues are affected.   We'd like to thank
the many contributors who helped with this release.

SQLAlchemy 0.9.5 is available on the `Download Page </download.html>`_.
