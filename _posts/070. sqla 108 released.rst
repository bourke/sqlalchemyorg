title: SQLAlchemy 1.0.8 Released
author: Mike B
---

SQLAlchemy release 1.0.8 is now available.

Release 1.0.8 comes almost immediately after 1.0.7, as a new issue
involving the connection pool has been identified and fixed which impacts
any application that relies upon consistent behavior of the ``.info``
dictionary on a connection that is undergoing reconnect attempts.
Applications and libraries which make use of connection pool event handlers
may benefit from this release, as it repairs the behavior of the ``.info``
dictionary and reduces the likelihood of stale connections being passed
to the "checkout" handler.

Changelog for 1.0.8 is at:
