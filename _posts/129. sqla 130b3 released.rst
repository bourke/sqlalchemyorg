title: SQLAlchemy 1.3.0b3 Released
author: Mike B

SQLAlchemy release 1.3.0b3 is now available.

Release 1.3.0b3 should hopefully be the last beta release for 1.3, as no
additional major changes are planned.   This release adds further restrictions
on deprecated behaviors, most notably removing most instances of automatic
coercion of Python strings that contain SQL fragments into ``text()`` objects;
this behavior has been emitting warnings since 1.0 so should not be something
in use by applications by now; as it has become an obscure feature it starts
to look more like a bug rather than a deprecated behavior, so the warnings
are now full exception messages.

The release also includes a variety of
related improvements in the area of SQL identifiers and quoting, as well
as some ORM-specific improvements.  Finally, support for the Nose testing
framework has been removed; SQLAlchemy has standardized on Py.test for some
years now and Nose no longer worked as a test platform under Python 3 in
any case.
