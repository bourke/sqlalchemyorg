title: SQLAlchemy 1.1.0b2 Released
author: Mike B
---

SQLAlchemy release 1.1.0b2 is now available.

A few small issues were reported with 1.1.0b1 which are resolved here.
Assuming things remain fairly quiet during the beta releases, 1.1.0 final
will be released in the coming weeks.  Typically, a lot more regressions
are reported once the beta stage is left as that's when the general population
starts using the release.

Users should carefully review the `What's New in SQLAlchemy 1.1? </docs/latest/changelog/migration_11.html>`_ document as well as the `Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_1_1_0b2>`_ to
note which behaviors and issues are affected.   We'd like to thank
the many contributors who helped with this release.

SQLAlchemy 1.1.0b2 is available on the `Download Page </download.html>`_.
