SQLAlchemy release 1.1.9 is now available.

A continuing stream of small regressions is leading us to have to
put out releases every few days at the moment.  This release
includes a fix to a regression that was caused by a fix to a regression
:), specifically the ``sqlalchemy.ext.mutable`` fix put out in 1.1.8.
It also fixes a different regression in the typing system introduced in 1.1.5,
and also has a regular bug fix for another issue regarding "connectionless"
execution.

Changelog for 1.1.9 is at `Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_1_1_9>`_.
