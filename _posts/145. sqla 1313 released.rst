title: SQLAlchemy 1.3.13 Released
author: Mike B

SQLAlchemy release 1.3.13 is now available.

Release 1.3.13 is a fairly ambitious bug-fix release which includes
a fair amount of ORM related fixes as well as a variety of internal changes
in order to greatly reduce reference cycles in both the Core and ORM
layers.    While these changes have been extensively tested,  there is
an increased usage of weak reference objects which can in theory impact
non-idiomatic code that deals with inspection of ORM internals in that
some objects may be garbage collected earlier than they would have previously.

See the changelog for descriptions of these new features as well as
an overview of bug fixes.

As is the case with all releases, we'd like to thank all the contributors who
helped with this release.
