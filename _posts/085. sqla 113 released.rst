SQLAlchemy release 1.1.3 is now available.

Release 1.1.3 continues a series of very fast releases since 1.1.0
was first released, containing fixes for several more small regressions.
As is usually the case with such regressions, each one involves an
unanticipated use case so are not expected to impact most
users.

Changelog for 1.1.3 is at `Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_1_1_3>`_.

SQLAlchemy 1.1.3 is available on the `Download Page </download.html>`_.
