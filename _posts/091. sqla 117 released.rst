title: SQLAlchemy 1.1.7 Released
author: Mike B

SQLAlchemy release 1.1.7 is now available.

Release 1.1.7 includes several bugfixes, one of which was introduced in 1.1.6
as a result of performance enhancements for joined eager loading which presents
as a race condition under certain multithreaded scenarios. Fixes also include
an important adjustment in the cx_Oracle dialect to adjust for changes in
cx_Oracle release 5.3, resolution of an extremely small memory leak which could
occur in the relatively unusual case that an arbitrarily high number of
savepoints were established on a single ``Connection`` object, as well as an
important fix in the "schema translate" feature.

Changelog for 1.1.7 is at `Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_1_1_7>`_.
