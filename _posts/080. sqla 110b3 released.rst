title: SQLAlchemy 1.1.0b3 Released
author: Mike B
---

SQLAlchemy release 1.1.0b3 is now available.

This is likely the last beta of the 1.1 series, which repairs a few
issues in the new CTE for UPDATE/INSERT feature.   Overall not many
regressions or issues have been reported in the beta series, however
this is typical; once the 1.1 final release comes out, the userbase
grows dramatically and more issues should be expected.

Users should carefully review the `What's New in SQLAlchemy 1.1? </docs/latest/changelog/migration_11.html>`_ document as well as the `Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_1_1_0b3>`_ to
note which behaviors and issues are affected.   We'd like to thank
the many contributors who helped with this release.

SQLAlchemy 1.1.0b3 is available on the `Download Page </download.html>`_.
