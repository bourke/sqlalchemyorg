SQLAlchemy release 1.0.18 is now available.

This release repairs an issue in the test suite that would prevent
the suite from passing on Python version 3.6.2.   The release is
made at the same time as that of release 1.1.12 and 1.2.0b2.  Additionally,
a backport from release 1.1.7 allowing cx_Oracle 5.3 to work correctly
is included in this release.

Changelog for 1.0.18 is at `Changelog </changes/CHANGES_1_0_18>`_.
