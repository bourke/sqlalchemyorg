title: SQLAlchemy Site Mini-Redesign
author: Mike B

That's not your eyes playing tricks on you, the SQLAlchemy logo is now
a little bigger.   Today, some modifications to the site layout have gone out,
including some new fonts, updated navigation, and an all new section
called `The Library </library.html>`_.   The Library is the new home
base for all kinds of documentation, blog posts, and videos about all things
SQLAlchemy.  The same old documentation links are right at the top, but beyond
that there's links to the `Architecture of Open Source <http://aosabook.org/en/sqlalchemy.html>`_
chapter, links to
Pycon talks as well as whatever else was handy.  We'd like users to be aware
of the very best of SQLAlchemy documentation resources so be sure to check
back with the Library every now and then for new additions.
