title: SQLAlchemy 1.3.0b2 Released
author: Mike B

SQLAlchemy release 1.3.0b2 is now available.

As the second beta release in the 1.3 series, version 1.3.0b2 has
a focus on looking towards the future, ensuring that all features
and behaviors that are long since deprecated fully emit a warning
as such to better allow them to be removed in subsequent
releases, as well as that some major new deprecations are added.
The goal is to apply more focus to the ORM and Core usage
APIs to allow easier transition to an eventual next generation
version of SQLAlchemy suited to a Python 3 only world.

Major changes in 1.3.0b2 include:

* The ``AliasedClass`` construct may now be specified as the target
  for a relationship, fully replacing the remaining rationale for the
  "non primary mapper" feature which becomes deprecated.

* The ``convert_unicode`` parameter on ``Engine`` and ``String``
  is deprecated, as unicode handling is now supplied by all supported
  DBAPIs.

* The "threadlocal" engine strategy, long an obsolete behavior, is
  finally deprecated.

* Deprecation warning are emitted for **all** functions, methods,
  and parameters that have already been noted in the documentation
  as deprecated.
