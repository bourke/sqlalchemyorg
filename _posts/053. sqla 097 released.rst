title: SQLAlchemy 0.9.7 Released
author: Mike B

SQLAlchemy release 0.9.7 is now available.

The 0.9 series is now entering maintenance mode where major new features
are now targeted at the 1.0 series.   Release 0.9.7 contains a wide range
of bugfixes, many of which are identified as regressions from previous 0.9.X
releases including three introduced in 0.9.5.   All relevant fixes are of
course forwards-ported to the 1.0 series and a handful are also backported
to 0.8.7, being released at the same time.

A small number of new features include Postgresql JSONB support, improved
Postgresql text matching features and a new event hook which allows database
exceptions to be intercepted and re-thrown as new ones.

Users should carefully review the `Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_0_9_7>`_ to
note which behaviors and issues are affected.   We'd like to thank
the many contributors who helped with this release.

SQLAlchemy 0.9.7 is available on the `Download Page </download.html>`_.
