SQLAlchemy release 1.3.7 is now available.

Release 1.3.7 has a considerable number of bug fixes across the ORM, SQL, and
database dialect components and a few new database use case additions,
including full support for psycopg2's fast execution helpers which can
significantly increase the performance of multiple INSERT statements.

As is the case with all releases, we'd like to thank all the contributors who
helped with this release.

Changelog for 1.3.7 is at `Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_1_3_7>`_.

SQLAlchemy 1.3.7 is available on the `Download Page </download.html>`_.
