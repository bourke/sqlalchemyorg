title: SQLAlchemy 1.0.3 Released
author: Mike B

SQLAlchemy release 1.0.3 is now available.

Release 1.0.3 is the latest in a series of weekly releases intended to quickly
address remaining small regressions that have come up since the 1.0.0 release.
One fairly serious unit-of-work regression regarding SQL expressions is fixed,
the new behavior regarding textual expressions with "ORDER BY" has been scaled
back a bit to better suit now-deprecated use cases, a little-used ORM event
hook was repaired as it prevented the SQLSoup package from working, and
the metadata "on create/on drop" events experienced a format change in one of
the lesser used arguments being passed, which was reverted to its previous
form.

The release also includes a few additional bug fixes and a series of new
features within the connection pool / dialect system to allow for better
visibility and customization of the connectivity process.
