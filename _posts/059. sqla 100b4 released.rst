title: SQLAlchemy 1.0.0b4 Released
author: Mike B

SQLAlchemy release 1.0.0b4 is now available.

This release contains a handful of fixes and enhancements mostly
to address issues that were reported by beta testers.  Things
are looking very good and it's hoped that *maybe* this will be the
last beta, unless a host of new regressions are reported.

In preparation for 1.0.0, production installations that haven't yet been
tested in the 1.0 series should be making sure that their requirements
files are capped at 0.9.99, to avoid surprise upgrades.

Changelog for 1.0.0b4 is at:

`Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_1_0_0b4>`_

SQLAlchemy 1.0.0b4 is available on the `Download Page </download.html>`_.
