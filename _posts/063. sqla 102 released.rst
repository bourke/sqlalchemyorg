title: SQLAlchemy 1.0.2 Released
author: Mike B

SQLAlchemy release 1.0.2 is now available.

As additional regressions are still being reported, we would like to
get these changes out as fast as possible so that early adopters are working
on a 1.0 version that is most representative of what its final form will
be.  1.0.2 includes two additional fixes, one of which was particularly
thorny in that it was already "fixed" in 1.0.0b4, but was not fixed correctly,
regarding the placement of plain label names in GROUP BY expressions; so the
incorrect fix is reverted and the original regression from 0.9 is resolved
as well.

Changelog for 1.0.2 is at:
