title: SQLAlchemy 1.0.6 Released
author: Mike B

SQLAlchemy release 1.0.6 is now available.

This release includes a handful of new bugfixes and some small feature adds,
pushed along by a high level of community involvement.

The most critical issue fixed involves the versioning feature of the
ORM, where the version counter of a row could be incremented when there
was otherwise no net change on the row; this was a regression from 0.9.  A
few other minor issues were also regressions or "semi-regressions" (e.g. a bug
that existed in 0.9, but is more likely to be encountered in 1.0 due to
greater use of a feature).  Issues involving the SQL Server ``VARBINARY``
type, ORM queries for "single inheritance" mappings, and support for the
very latest (2.7.1) release of psycopg2cffi are resolved.

The new features are all Postgresql centric, and include support for setting
the storage parameters of a Postgresql index, as well as reflection of
those parameters and the "using" algorithm of an index; fixes to the
``ExcludeConstraint`` construct to allow more open-ended SQL expressions,
and support for controlling the size of the row buffer used when
"server side cursor" mode is used.
