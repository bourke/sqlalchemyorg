title: SQLAlchemy 0.9.2 Released
author: Mike B

SQLAlchemy release 0.9.2 is now available.

Release 0.9.2, while only a "point release" in the new 0.9 series,
contains a large list of bug and regression fixes across ORM, Core
and dialect, as well as a significant number of new features, particularly
in the area of database metadata management.

Features include a "naming convention" system for database metadata
that is hoped to assist with schema management, including when using
Alembic migrations, as well as new options for constraints, Postgresql
table reflection, and copying of table metadata.   Support and
documentation has been improved for some advanced ORM patterns such as
creating relationships to complex targets.

The release also features a lot of regression fixes, so is recommended for
all users who have already upgraded to the 0.9 series.

Among other bugfixes, there are quite a few dialect-specific bug fixes including
four for MySQL alone, as well as Oracle, Postgresql, MSSQL, and SQLite, as well
as a good number of ORM fixes.
