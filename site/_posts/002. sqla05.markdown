title: SQLAlchemy 0.5.0 Released
---
In progress since Pycon 2008, the first official release of the 0.5 series is
now available. This version packs a huge amount of change since 0.4 including
multiple paradigm shifts in usage as well as countless bugfixes and behavioral
and speed improvements. Through a series of prereleases, 0.5 is already on
production systems and has been extensively tested by dozens of users. With
the first 0.5 release, 0.6 is underway as well and will be where Py3k support
is targeted. SQLAlchemy 0.5 is available for download on the <a
href="/download.html">download page</a>. A comprehensive migration document is
at <a href="/trac/wiki/05Migration">05Migration</a>.
