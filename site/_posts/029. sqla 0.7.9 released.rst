author: Mike B

SQLAlchemy 0.7.9 is released.  This is a maintenance release primarily
containing bug fixes applied to both the 0.7 and 0.8 SQLAlchemy series.

0.7.9 includes some adjustments that will also be present in 0.8, including
changes to the event-dispatch system which dramatically reduce the amount
of memory used.   There are also several fixes related to the relatively
new common table expression (CTE) construct.

Other fixes include small bugs present in components such as the ORM,
SQL generation system, and various dialect-specific bugs.   0.7.9 also
has updates to its unit test system which were backported from 0.8.

The 0.8 series, which includes a long list of new features and improvements,
is more or less ready for initial beta releases, and will be available for
download within the coming weeks.
