SQLAlchemy release 0.6.7 is now available.  This is a bugfix
release to the 0.6 series, which is now mostly feature frozen.
The 0.7 series has been the focus of development and new
features for several months and is very near to production 
release - 0.6.7 represents all those bugfixes that were appropriate
for an 0.6.7 backport.

The 0.6 series has been SQLAlchemy's most popular ever, with 
0.6.6 logging over 52,000 downloads in just four months.
