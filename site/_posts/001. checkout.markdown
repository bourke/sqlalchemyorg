title: Checkout Now Available at the Apple Store

<a
href="http://www.checkoutapp.com/">Checkout</a> 2.0 is now available from
every Apple store as well straight from <a
href="http://www.madebysofa.com/">Madebysofa</a>; it's the software that turns
any Mac into an event-driven networked cash register and inventory system.
Version 2.0 is built entirely on SQLAlchemy interfacing with SQLite. The guys
from Madebysofa just shipped me a free boxed copy (shown at left). SQLAlchemy
however has no plans to start charging ;) .
