title: SQLAlchemy 0.8.5 Released
author: Mike B

SQLAlchemy release 0.8.5 is now available.

Release 0.8.5 is a bugfix release which includes a wide array of fixes
backported from the 0.9 series.  Both 0.8.5 and 0.9.3 are being released
simultaneously to resolve a concurrency-related
regression introduced in version 0.8.4, which can cause a dialect to
sporadically be used in a mis-configured state when it first connects.  For
this reason, 0.8.5 is recommended for all users on 0.8.4.

Other improvements include updates to the Postgresql dialect to better handle
schema reflection when working with old versions of Postgresql,
namely pre-0.8.1 versions, which should also have a positive effect on those
users using Amazon Redshift.

Users should carefully review the `Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_0_8_5>`_ to
note which behaviors and issues are affected.   We'd like to thank
the many contributors who helped with this release.

SQLAlchemy 0.8.5 is available on the `Download Page </download.html>`_.
