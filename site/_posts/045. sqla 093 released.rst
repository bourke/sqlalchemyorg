title: SQLAlchemy 0.9.3 Released
author: Mike B

SQLAlchemy release 0.9.3 is now available.

Release 0.9.3 includes a wide array of bugfixes and a few new
features.   A critical subset of these fixes are also backported to
release 0.8.5.  Both 0.9.3 and 0.8.5 are being released simultaneously to
resolve a concurrency-related
regression introduced in version 0.8.4, which can cause a dialect to
sporadically be used in a mis-configured state when it first connects.
For this reason, 0.9.3 is recommended for all users of the 0.9 series.

Other improvements include updates to the Postgresql dialect to better handle
schema reflection when working with old versions of Postgresql,
namely pre-0.8.1 versions, which should also have a positive effect on those
users using Amazon Redshift.   0.9.3 also includes improved support for
SQLite type reflection, using SQLite's "type affinity" rules to unconditionally
reflect all possible datatypes declared within a database.

Users should carefully review the `Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_0_9_3>`_ to
note which behaviors and issues are affected.   We'd like to thank
the many contributors who helped with this release.

SQLAlchemy 0.9.3 is available on the `Download Page </download.html>`_.
