SQLAlchemy release 0.7.1 is now available.   This is a relatively
small bugfix release for the new 0.7 series.

The release includes a workaround for a C compilation issue on 64-bit Windows
systems, and a variety of other fixes.  It also includes a new feature,
in that the restriction on "delete-orphan" cascade for self-referential
relationships has been lifted.

The full changelog for version 0.7.1 is at `CHANGES </changelog/CHANGES_0_7_1>`_.
