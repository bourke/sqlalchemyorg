title: SQLAlchemy 0.7.8 Released
author: Mike B

SQLAlchemy 0.7.8 is released.  This is a maintenance release containing
significant bug fixes applied to both the 0.7 and 0.8 SQLAlchemy series.

Significant issues resolved include a memory leak identified when the 
C extensions were installed in conjunction with usage of the Pyodbc DBAPI
driver, and possibly other drivers that use a custom non-tuple for 
result rows; as well as a Python 3 issue where the ``execute()`` method of ``Engine``
and ``Connection`` would not interpret positional arguments correctly.
Users who are using the Pyodbc driver in conjunction with the C extensions
on any platform are encouraged to upgrade.

There's also a new dialect added that should allow usage of the new MySQL 
engine provided by Google App Engine.

Overall, 0.7.8 has few changes versus 0.7.7, particularly within the 
ORM component, save for a few fixes.   Users are advised to fully
test existing applications before upgrading in any case.
