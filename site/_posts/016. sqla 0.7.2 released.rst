title: SQLAlchemy 0.7.2 Released
author: Mike B
---
SQLAlchemy release 0.7.2 is now available.   This release contains
many bugfixes for bugs present in both the 0.6 and 0.7 series, as well
as some 0.7 only fixes and a few new features.

0.7.2 includes behavioral enhancements to joined- and subquery-eager
loading, a new feature to the typing system called ``with_variant()``
which allows a single type to act as a different type on selected
backends, and improved string displays for several kinds of exceptions.
The documentation has also been improved for clarity in many areas.

More features and documentation improvements are on the way for 0.7.3,
including some new Declarative features.   The current focus of development
is on fully standardizing SQLAlchemy documentation and usage 
patterns on Declarative, with most direct usage of the ``mapper()`` function 
intended for special cases and custom ORM configurational layers, 
created either in-house or as part of external open source extension
layers.
