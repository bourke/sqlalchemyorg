title: SQLAlchemy 0.7.5 Released
author: Mike B
---
SQLAlchemy release 0.7.5 is now available.   This release
includes some major bugfixes, as well as a handful of 
new features:

* Relationship loaders like ``joinedload()`` accept 
  a "wildcard" character, e.g. ``'*'``, to establish
  the "default loading strategy" for a query.
* New reflection features allow autoloading of tables
  to be smoothly integrated with Declarative
  mappings, allowing database connectivity to 
  be established in a later step after classes have
  been defined.
* Multiple Declarative bases can share the same
  registry of class names.
