title: SQLAlchemy 0.7.7 Released
author: Mike B
---
SQLAlchemy 0.7.7 is now available.  This is the first release of the 0.7
series subsequent to the promotion of the 0.8 series to trunk.   It nearly 
two dozen bug fixes and features, including some significant ORM issues
that have been resolved.   

Development is now proceeding with the 0.8 series, which begins
to push 0.7 into maintenance mode.  Bug fixes and some 
features are being backported to 0.7 as is possible.   The 0.6 series 
also launches 0.6.9 at the same time as 0.7.7, in an effort to "push out"
all the pending fixes for both the 0.6 and 0.7 series, so that development
on 0.8 can continue.

While changes from 0.7.6 to 0.7.7 are intended to be fully backwards 
compatible, existing installations running on 0.7 should refer to the CHANGES file
to determine if and how they may be impacted by the fixes in 0.7.7 
before upgrading, and users are advised to fully test their applications
against 0.7.7 before promoting to production.
