SQLAlchemy release 0.8.1 is now available.

This is a bugfix release which resolves many issues, some of which appeared
in 0.8.0 as regressions and many more that affect all versions.

Major issues resolved include a significant rework to the ``Query.join()``
method, as well as a major fix to an issue regarding overlapping column
labels affecting primarily the ORM.   In total, there are 27 bug fixes listed
in the `Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_0_8_1>`_.   We'd like to thank
the many contributors who helped with this release.

SQLAlchemy 0.8.1 is available on the `Download Page </download.html>`_.
