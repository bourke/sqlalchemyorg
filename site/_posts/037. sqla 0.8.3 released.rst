SQLAlchemy release 0.8.3 is now available.

0.8.3 is a bugfix release containing several dozen fixes, and a few features
backported from the upcoming 0.9.0b1 release planned for the same time.

Areas of improvement include ORM, Core, and fixes for dialects like that
of MySQL, Postgresql, Oracle, and SQLite.

Users should carefully review the `Changelog </changelog/CHANGES_0_8_3>`_ to
note which behaviors and issues are affected.   We'd like to thank
the many contributors who helped with this release.

SQLAlchemy 0.8.3 is available on the `Download Page </download.html>`_.
