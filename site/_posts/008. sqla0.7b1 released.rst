The first beta release of SQLAlchemy 0.7 is now available. This
release features the past year's worth of new features,
improvements, and usage patterns, including an all-new, unified
event model, new extensions including so-called "hybrid" attributes
as well as a new system of tracking changes on "mutable" scalar
values, extensive performance improvements, new dialects, and a
large number of other features and bug fixes. A full catalog of
changes can be reviewed at `07Migration </trac/wiki/07Migration>`_. Download SQLAlchemy
0.7 beta1 on the `download page </download.html>`_.
