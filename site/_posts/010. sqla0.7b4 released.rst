title: SQLAlchemy 0.7 Beta 4 Released
author: Mike B
---
Beta 4 of SQLAlchemy 0.7 has been released.  This is most likely the last
beta of version 0.7 before final release.   0.7 has been downloaded many hundreds
of times and a small series of regressions have been fixed; it is used in at
least a few production installations already.

Of particular note in this release:

* Support for psycopg2, the Postgresql driver, on Python 3
* The C extensions now build by default for the Python 2 platform.
* Support for Python 3 builds using plain Python Distutils, or Distribute.
* Full test success for Pypy, Python 3.2
* Lots of bugfixes and revised documentation, including the new 
  `Revised index page </docs/07/>`_.

0.7beta4 owes a lot to the sprinters at this year's Pycon; a subsequent blog post
detailing the sprints for this year is coming soon.

The SQLAlchemy 0.7 series represents a great leap forward in functionality 
and performance - the upgrade path starts by reviewing the 
`07Migration </trac/wiki/07Migration>`_ document.

Changes can be reviewed at `CHANGES </changelog/CHANGES_0_7b4>`_; download
SQLAlchemy 0.7beta4 on the `download page </download.html>`_.
