title: Pycon 2010 Sprints the Biggest Ever
author: Mike B
---
The sprinting continues today in Atlanta after a week where at least a dozen people got involved,
some new to SQLAlchemy, some veterans.   New things coming out include our <a href="http://buildbot.sqlalchemy.org/">all-new
buildbot</a>, as well as several new dialects which are Python 3 compatible - PyPostgreql, OurSQL, MySQL-connector-Python.  Python 3 tests
are passing 100% for pg8000 and OurSQL, so Postgresql and MySQL are now covered for Python 3.  We also have mxODBC for MSSQL in the
works and have made a great leap forward in getting real Sybase support.   Plus documentation updates galore, new
declarative features, and a whole host of fixes and enhancements elsewhere.   We'll soon be posting
links to SQLAlchemy related talks and tutorials from Pycon 2010 as they become available.  Thanks to 
everyone for the huge amount of involvement and stay tuned for SQLAlchemy 0.6 !
