author: Mike B

Armin Ronacher introduces SQLAlchemy to the `Django <http://www.djangoproject.com/>`_ community 
in his latest post `SQLAlchemy and You <http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2011/7/19/sqlachemy-and-you/>`_,
a gentle introduction to the differences in philosophy between the SQLAlchemy and Django
ORMs, with a good deal of specifics.

Armin is the creator of `Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_, a fast-growing
web framework that places an emphasis on the SQLAlchemy ORM for relational database
usage.
