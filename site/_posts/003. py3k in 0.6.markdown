title: Python 3K, pg8000 Support in SQLAlchemy 0.6
---
As of this past weekend, <a href="http://twitter.com/zzzeek/status/1984474807">100% of tests pass</a> on Python 3000 using
the up-and-coming 0.6 series of SQLAlchemy, while running on sqlite via the sqlite3 adapter
as well as Postgresql via the <a href="http://pybrary.net/pg8000/">pg8000</a> DBAPI.
Jython compatibility is largely present as well.   The 0.6 series has
a special focus on environment and dialect compatibility, as well as on schema construct and DDL improvements.
Developers will have full access to new expression constructs such as CREATE TABLE and ADD CONSTRAINT, with the ability
to define new ones.  It is now possible to construct custom create/drop sequences which add constraints, triggers 
and other DDL using rules that are sensitive to the underlying database in use - and will allow smoother integration
with <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sqlalchemy-migrate/">sqlalchemy-migrate</a> too.  0.6 should be merged to trunk
soon with alpha releases by mid-summer.
