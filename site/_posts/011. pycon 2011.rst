Thanks to all who participated in this year's sprints at Pycon 2011.   
The releases of 0.6.7 and 0.7b4 owe a lot to what the group got done, 
including Pypy test coverage, unit test improvements, dialect
fixes, lots of documentation tweaks and edits, some impressive 
ORM fixes, and other features.   The sprints have also fostered
an ongoing discussion on how we can keep the mailing lists diverse
and increase the rate of communication - some website changes have
already been made, including this blog, and more are in the works.
