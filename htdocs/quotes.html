<p>The only toolkit that's even better? SQLAlchemy. It's pretty much the only way I'll interact with RDBMS systems in Python from this point out. And I don't mean I'll be writing every RDBMS interaction as an object-relational mapping. SQLAlchemy is great because it provides a good connection / pooling infrastructure; a good Pythonic query building infrastructure; and then a good ORM infrastructure that is capable of complex queries and mappings (as well as some pretty stone-simple ones).</p>

<p>SQLAlchemy is a pretty amazing design...In SQLAlchemy, you need to explicitly start a session. What's amazing is that all the changes you make during that session are kept in some kind of parse tree, and then when the session ends SQL is created on-the-fly to produce a single, optimal SQL statement for that particular sequence of changes. I found this idea pretty mind-blowing.</p>

I've been using SQLAlchemy for about two days now and I can tell you, it's without compare. The ORM is the most flexible I've ever seen. It's freaking magic.

<p>What's not to like? Support for multi-table inheritance? Check. Database to object mapping responsibilities seperated (e.g. no ClassName.findme())? Check.</p>

<p>And most importantly - An actual query engine, not some ad-hoc string munging hackery going on behind the scenes, but an object model created by a simple meta-language in Python, and then compiled to the appropriate database SQL statement. Forever and ever, amen. </p>

As a user of all kinds of ORMs and a write of plenty of my own, I've got to say I am extremely impressed by SQLAlchemy...It is wonderfully documented, and has a great philosophy. If you are using anything else, you should definitely try this.

Very sweet, and very quick to get going on my Mac development and Linux deployment environments. I'm currently collecting data from three different databases (SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MySql) on five different servers. This is a killer app for me.

I'll be exploring its object-relational capabilities soon, but I am already very fond of the framework, and how lightweight it feels.

Using SQLAlchemy has certainly changed the way I think about database access when I'm designing an application.
