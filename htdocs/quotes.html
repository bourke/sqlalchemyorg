As a user of all kinds of ORMs and a write of plenty of my own, I've got to say I am extremely impressed by SQLAlchemy...It is wonderfully documented, and has a great philosophy. If you are using anything else, you should definitely try this.

Very sweet, and very quick to get going on my Mac development and Linux deployment environments. I'm currently collecting data from three different databases (SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MySql) on five different servers. This is a killer app for me.

I'll be exploring its object-relational capabilities soon, but I am already very fond of the framework, and how lightweight it feels.

Using SQLAlchemy has certainly changed the way I think about database access when I'm designing an application.

I've been using SQLAlchemy for about two days now and I can tell you, it's without compare. The ORM is the most flexible Iv'e ever seen. It's freaking magic.
