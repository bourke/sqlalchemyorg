<h1>The Python SQL Toolkit and Object Relational Mapper</h1>

<p>SQLAlchemy is the Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL.</p>
<p>It provides a full suite of well known enterprise-level persistence patterns, designed for efficient and high-performing database access, adapted into a simple and Pythonic domain language.</p>

<h2>SQLALCHEMY'S PHILOSOPHY</h2>

<p class="philos">SQL databases behave less like object collections the more size and performance start to matter; object collections behave less like tables and rows the more abstraction starts to matter. SQLAlchemy aims to accommodate both of these principles.</p>

<p>SQLAlchemy doesn't view databases as just collections of tables; it sees them as relational algebra engines. Its object relational mapper enables classes to be mapped against the database in more than one way.  SQL constructs don't just select from just tables&#8212;you can also select from joins, subqueries, and unions. Thus database relationships and domain object models can be cleanly decoupled from the beginning, allowing both sides to develop to their full potential.</p>

           <p>SQLAlchemy places the highest value on not getting in the way of database and application architecture.  Unlike many tools, it <b>never</b> "generates" schemas (not to be confused with issuing user-defined <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Definition_Language">DDL</a>, in which it excels) or relies on naming conventions of any kind.  SQLAlchemy supports the widest variety of database and architectural designs as is reasonably possible.

            Modular and Extensible
        </td>
        <td class="featuredesc">
            <p>Different parts of SQLAlchemy can be used independently of the rest.  Elements like connection pooling, SQL statement compilation and transactional services can be used independently of each other, and can also be extended through various plugin points.  The Object Relational Mapper (ORM) is a separate package which builds on top of these, and itself has several extension systems for modifying behavior at various levels.</p>
           <p>SQLAlchemy's extensible nature has spawned a whole community of plugins and third party extensions, including:</p>

                <p>SQLAlchemy has a substantially sized community, with over 1200 mailing list users and well over 3000 downloads a month.  It is the default ORM for most of the popular web frameworks, including <a href="http://www.pylonshq.com">Pylons</a>, <a href="http://www.turbogears.org">Turbogears</a> and <a href="http://grok.zope.org/">Grok</a>.

		<p>Development is similarly active, with an active developer count hovering around ten, around 200 commits per month and a typical release pace of one point release per month, one major version release every six months (see <a href="/trac">SQLAlchemy Trac</a> for development timeline and project information</a>).
