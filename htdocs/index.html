<h1>The Python SQL Toolkit and Object Relational Mapper</h1>

<p>SQLAlchemy is the Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL.</p>
<p>It provides a full suite of well known enterprise-level persistence patterns, designed for efficient and high-performing database access, adapted into a simple and Pythonic domain language.</p>

<h2>SQLALCHEMY'S PHILOSOPHY</h2>

<p class="philos">SQL databases behave less and less like object collections the more size and performance start to matter; object collections behave less and less like tables and rows the more abstraction starts to matter. SQLAlchemy aims to accommodate both of these principles.</p>

<p>SQLAlchemy doesn't view databases as just collections of tables; it sees them as relational algebra engines. Its object relational mapper enables classes to be mapped against the database in more than one way.  SQL constructs don't just select from just tables&#8212;you can also select from joins, subqueries, and unions. Thus database relationships and domain object models can be cleanly decoupled from the beginning, allowing both sides to develop to their full potential.</p>

            <p>Different parts of SQLAlchemy can be used independently of the rest.  You can use the connection pool by itself and deal with raw connections; or you can use the SQL construction language by itself, either in direct conjunction with one or more database connections or as standalone constructs which return their string-compiled contents.  While SQLAlchemy has a great ORM provided, the other parts have no dependency on it; its usage is completely optional.  Simpler facades for the ORM can be used as well, such as the popular <a href="http://elixir.ematia.de/">Elixir</a> Declarative Layer and the <a href="/trac/wiki/SqlSoup">SqlSoup</a> Row Gateway.  SQLAlchemy is architected in an open style that allows plenty of customization, supporting user-defined datatypes, custom SQL extensions, and a plugin system which can augment or extend any functionality including SQL expressions and ORM behavior.</p>

			Community Supported

		<p>SQLAlchemy has an active user community.  The communities of both <a href="http://www.pylonshq.com">Pylons</a> and <a href="http://www.turbogears.org">Turbogears</a> are largely involved with SQLAlchemy as it's the central ORM platform used by both frameworks; not to mention that there are no less than three integration frameworks available for <a href="http://www.zope.org">Zope</a>.  The popular <a href="http://elixir.ematia.de/">Elixir</a> project provides a so-called "declarative" layer on top of SQLAlchemy which retains the feel of popular <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/activeRecord.html">active record</a> tools.  SQLAlchemy itself includes several user-provided extensions, such as <a href="/trac/wiki/SqlSoup">SqlSoup</a> and <a href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/docs/plugins.html#plugins_orderinglist">orderinglist</a>.  The <a href="http://trac.erosson.com/migrate/">Migrate</a> project, which is currently seeking developers, intends to provide schema migration support as well.</p>

	<p>SQLAlchemy is currently involved in integration projects (or is integrated) with the following systems:

		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://www.pylonshq.com">Pylons</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://www.turbogears.org">Turbogears</a></li>
