<h2>Guideline for tickets:</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Your issue will be taken seriously if you take the creation of the ticket seriously.</li>
	<li>If you do not take the ticket creation seriously, it wastes time for everyone.  These tickets will be closed.</li>
	<li>Tickets which do not include test scripts, test scripts which cannot actually be run, or test scripts which don't illustrate the issue indicate someone not taking things very seriously.</li>
</ul>
